# crypto
A web app to analyze real time trends in various cryptocurrencies and an analysis to identify outliers who do not follow the bitcoin trend.

The web-app is created using the dash framework on python. A database of news articles and price values of more than 1000 cryptocurrencies was created on AWS for this web app.

Note that the app is not live as the database is no longer live.
